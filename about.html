          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            In an increasingly globalized world, understanding different
            communication styles is essential for effective cross-cultural
            interaction. This assessment tool was created to help students and
            professionals recognize their own communication preferences and
            learn how to adapt when interacting with people from different
            cultural backgrounds.

          <h2>The Science Behind It</h2>
          <p>
            Our assessment is based on established research in intercultural
            communication, particularly the work of anthropologist Edward T.
            Hall on high-context and low-context cultures. The questionnaire
            measures preferences across key dimensions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Directness:</strong> How explicitly you communicate your
              messages
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Context Sensitivity:</strong> Your awareness of non-verbal
              cues and implicit meaning
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relationship vs. Task Orientation:</strong> Whether you
              prioritize relationships or goals
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conflict Resolution Style:</strong> How you approach
              disagreements
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time Perception:</strong> Your attitude toward punctuality
              and deadlines
            </li>
          </ul>
